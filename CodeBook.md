The purpose of this file is to explain the workings behind the run_analysis file and the data's variables, data, and transformations! Enjoy and learn!
##Variables
- Subject : This is the assigned number of each subject ranging from 1 to 30.
- Activity : The kind of activity they are doing which mainly consists of 6 activities (Walking, Walking Upstairs, Walking Downstairs, Sitting, Standing, and Laying)
- All other measurements are floating-points values, normalised and bounded within [-1,1]. The measurements are classified in two domains:
- Time-domain signals (variables prefixed by timeDomain), resulting from the capture of acceloremeter and gyroscope raw signals.
- Frequency-domain signals (variables prefixed by frequencyDomain), resulting from the application of a Fast Fourier Transform (FFT) to some of the time-domain signals.
