## About the Dataset
The dataset used here is referenced from the research of Jorge L. Reyes-Ortiz, Davide Anguita, Alessandro Ghio, and Luca Oneto titled "Human Activity Recognition on Smartphone using a Multiclass Hardware-Friendly SUpport Vector Machine".

The experiments have been carried out with a gruop of 30 volunteers within an age bracket of 19-48 years. Each person performed six activities (WALKING, WALKING_UPSTAIRS, WALKING_DOWNSTAIRS, SITTING, STANDING, LAYING) wearing a smartphone (Samsung Galaxy S II) on the waist. The obtained dataset has been randomly partitioned into two sets, where 70% of the volunteers was selected for generating the training data and 30% the test data.
